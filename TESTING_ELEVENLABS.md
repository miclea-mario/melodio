# Testing ElevenLabs Integration

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

I've implemented the **real ElevenLabs Conversation API integration**! Here's what changed:

### Before (Placeholder)

- Mock implementation that didn't connect to ElevenLabs
- No actual audio playback
- No session visibility in dashboard

### After (Real Implementation)

- ‚úÖ Full ElevenLabs Conversation API integration
- ‚úÖ Real audio playback through your browser
- ‚úÖ Dynamic variables passed to agent
- ‚úÖ Sessions visible in ElevenLabs dashboard
- ‚úÖ Audio visualization with Web Audio API
- ‚úÖ Real-time message transcripts

## üîß Setup Required

### 1. Verify API Keys

Make sure your `.env.local` has:

```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_5301k7s1cq5hekm8jtrx4tqq2mjy
```

**Note**: We need BOTH versions of the API key:

- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - for server-side (Convex)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - for client-side (browser)

### 2. Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

This ensures the new environment variable is loaded.

### 3. Configure Your Agent

In ElevenLabs dashboard:

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Open agent `agent_5301k7s1cq5hekm8jtrx4tqq2mjy`
3. Update the System Prompt with the one that includes dynamic variables (see the prompt I gave you earlier)
4. Save the changes

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Test 1: Complete Flow

1. **Sign In** to the app
2. **Complete Profile Setup** (if first time)
3. Click **"Start Meditation"**
4. **Answer Mood Questions** (4 questions)
5. You'll be taken to the meditation session page

### Test 2: Audio Connection

On the meditation session page:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12)
   - Look for: `‚úÖ Connected to ElevenLabs agent`
   - Look for: `Starting ElevenLabs session with variables:`

2. **Listen for Audio**
   - The agent should start speaking automatically
   - You should hear: "Hello [Your Name]..."
   - The agent will reference your mood and occupation

3. **Check Microphone**
   - Your browser will ask for microphone permission
   - **Grant permission** - the agent needs to hear you for interaction
   - The agent is conversational, not just one-way audio

### Test 3: Audio Visualization

1. **Watch the ORB**
   - It should pulse and animate with the agent's voice
   - Changes size based on audio amplitude
   - Color shifts with frequency

2. **Browser Console Check**
   - Look for: `‚úÖ Using ElevenLabs built-in audio analyser`
   - Should see frequency data being logged

### Test 4: Chat Interface

1. **Click the chat button** (speech bubble icon)
2. **See Transcripts**
   - Agent messages appear on the left (teal background)
   - Your responses appear on the right (gray background)

### Test 5: Controls

1. **Play/Pause** - Should work (pauses audio output)
2. **Volume** - Adjust slider (changes agent volume)
3. **Stop** - Ends session and saves to database

### Test 6: ElevenLabs Dashboard

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Click on your agent
3. Go to **"Analytics"** or **"Logs"**
4. You should see your session listed
5. You can replay the conversation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Audio / Can't Hear Anything

**Possible Causes:**

1. **API Key Not Set**

   ```bash
   # Check if variable exists
   cd melodio
   cat .env.local | grep NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
   ```

   - If missing, add it to `.env.local`
   - Restart dev server

2. **Browser Permissions**
   - Check if microphone is blocked
   - Chrome: Click the üîí icon in address bar
   - Allow microphone access
   - Refresh the page

3. **Audio Output Device**
   - Check your computer's volume
   - Make sure speakers/headphones are connected
   - Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

4. **Invalid Agent ID**
   - Verify in ElevenLabs dashboard that agent exists
   - Make sure it's not deleted or archived

### Session Not Showing in Dashboard

**Causes:**

1. **Wrong Agent ID**
   - Double-check `NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID` in `.env.local`
2. **API Key Doesn't Match**
   - Make sure you're logged into the same ElevenLabs account
   - API key must belong to the account that owns the agent

3. **Session Not Started**
   - Check browser console for connection errors
   - Look for red error messages

### ORB Not Animating

**This is normal if:**

1. Agent hasn't started speaking yet (it animates with audio)
2. Audio is paused
3. Very quiet audio (increase volume)

**Check:**

1. Browser console for errors
2. Make sure audio is actually playing
3. Try increasing volume

### Connection Errors

**"ElevenLabs API key is required"**

- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
- Restart server

**"Failed to connect"**

- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is valid
- Try in incognito mode (extensions can interfere)

**"WebSocket connection failed"**

- Check firewall/antivirus
- Try disabling VPN
- Use Chrome (best WebSocket support)

## üìä Expected Behavior

### On Connection

```
Console Output:
‚úÖ Connected to ElevenLabs agent
Starting ElevenLabs session with variables: {
  user_name: "Alex",
  user_gender: "male",
  user_occupation: "Developer",
  mood_summary: "Feeling stressed...",
  mood_details: "[...]"
}
```

### During Session

- Agent speaks first with personalized greeting
- You can respond via microphone
- ORB pulses with audio
- Chat shows transcripts in real-time
- Timer counts up

### On Disconnect

```
Console Output:
‚ùå Disconnected from ElevenLabs agent: { reason: "user_ended", code: 1000 }
```

## üéØ What To Test

### Dynamic Variables Working

Listen for the agent to:

- ‚úÖ Use your name
- ‚úÖ Reference your occupation
- ‚úÖ Address your specific mood
- ‚úÖ Tailor meditation to your emotional state

### Audio Quality

- ‚úÖ Clear voice (no distortion)
- ‚úÖ Natural pacing
- ‚úÖ Ambient soundscapes (if configured)
- ‚úÖ Smooth transitions

### Interaction

- ‚úÖ Agent responds to your voice
- ‚úÖ Two-way conversation
- ‚úÖ Natural turn-taking
- ‚úÖ Context awareness

## üì± Browser Compatibility

**Recommended: Chrome/Edge**

- Best WebSocket support
- Best Web Audio API support
- Best microphone handling

**Also Works: Firefox, Safari**

- May need additional permissions
- Slightly different audio handling

**Not Recommended: Older browsers**

- Need modern Web Audio API support
- Need WebSocket support

## üîç Debugging Checklist

Run through this if things aren't working:

```bash
# 1. Check environment variables
cd melodio
cat .env.local

# 2. Verify both API keys are set
grep ELEVENLABS_API_KEY .env.local

# 3. Restart dev server
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal
npm run dev

# 4. Check browser console (F12)
# Look for connection messages

# 5. Test microphone
# Try recording in another app first

# 6. Verify agent in dashboard
# Go to elevenlabs.io and check agent exists
```

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Browser console shows "Connected to ElevenLabs agent"
2. ‚úÖ You hear the agent speaking
3. ‚úÖ Agent uses your name and references your mood
4. ‚úÖ ORB animates with the audio
5. ‚úÖ Chat shows transcripts
6. ‚úÖ Session appears in ElevenLabs dashboard
7. ‚úÖ Session saves to your history when you stop

## üéâ Next Steps

Once everything works:

1. **Try Different Moods**: Answer questions differently to see how the agent adapts
2. **Talk to the Agent**: Have a conversation, it's interactive!
3. **Check Session History**: View your past sessions on the home page
4. **Customize the Agent**: Modify the system prompt in ElevenLabs dashboard
5. **Adjust Visualization**: Tweak ORB behavior in `components/MeditationOrb.tsx`

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Most errors will show there
2. **Check Network Tab**: See if WebSocket connection fails
3. **Test API Key**: Try it directly in ElevenLabs dashboard
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes helps with connection issues
5. **Try Incognito**: Rules out extension interference

---

**The integration is now complete and should work!** üéä

Just make sure:

- Environment variables are set
- Dev server is restarted
- Agent is configured in dashboard
- Browser permissions are granted

Happy meditating! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®
